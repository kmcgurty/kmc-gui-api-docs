# Introduction

## What is this?

This is a GUI API that aims to give you (a developer) the ability to create an easy-to-use and fully expandable mod menu, without having to spend the time creating one from scratch.

If you've found yourself here thinking this is a mod menu that does something on its own - you're in the wrong place.

## Installation

Link Steam and Github

## Getting Started

I recommend downloading the demo GUI I've created. It shows how to do most things you will need with the API. 

#### Navigation

- `m` is to activate the menu
- `w, s` or `up, down` will navigate the menu
- `a` or `left` is to go back
- `d`, `left`, or `return` is to select a button.

#### Source Code

The source code for the mod can be found in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Teardown\mods\`
