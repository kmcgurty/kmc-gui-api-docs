# Introduction

## What is this?

This is a GUI API that aims to give you (a developer) the ability to create an easy-to-use and fully expandable mod menu, without having to spend the time creating one from scratch.

If you've found yourself here thinking this is a mod menu that does something on its own - you're in the wrong place. This is built for mod developers.

## Installation

You can find a link to download the demo here: [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424062619](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2424062619)

And a link to the standalone GUI here [https://github.com/kmcgurty/kmc-gui-demo/releases/latest](https://github.com/kmcgurty/kmc-gui-demo/releases/latest)

If you install the mod from Steam, you will have to select the mod and click "Make local copy" from inside the game menu.

## Getting Started

The source code for the demo can be found in `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Teardown\mods\Kmc_GUI Mod Menu Demo`

#### Default Navigation

- `m` is to activate the menu
- `w, s` or `up, down` will navigate the menu
- `a` or `left` is to go back
- `d`, `left`, or `return` is to select a button.

Once you see how the menu works in-game, head over to [Usage Guide](usage-guide) for a detailed explanation.
